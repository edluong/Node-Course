--Middleware--
-a middleware function takes a response function and passes it to another middlware function

-an example is a request and then we terminate the *Request Processing Pipeline* with a response
-another example is to get the req.body and then pass it to the express.json function

-Request Processing Pipeline will have one or more middleware function example: Request -> json() ->route()  -> Response

-express has built in middleware function but we can create custom ones as needed

--built in middleware--
-app.use(express.json())  //will get the req.body

-app.use(express.urlencoded()); //this will parse incoming url with variable payloads example: key=value&key=value; this the traditional way and not used often

-An example for app.use(express.urlencoded) is in Postman with the post method. When posting use the form urlencoded option for the Body 

then fill out the Key with "name" and then value will be "new course"
