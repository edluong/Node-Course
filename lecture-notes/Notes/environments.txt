--Environments--
-Need to know which environment it is on
-process object (node object) can give us the environment variable. process.env.Node_ENV //default: undefinded
-express has a way of telling you environment by app.get('env')
-change the process object by doing: export Node_ENV=production

--Managing different Environments--
-Can use two modules rc(most popular one) or config
-DO NOT store passwords and then push it onto repos
-we can deal with not storing passwords by saving them into environment variables
--To do this 3 easy steps:
*create an environment variables using export (Appname_password) = (password); this is used to not have clashing of variables
*create a file in the config folder called custom-environment-variables.json (has to be exactly named)
*then add in the password by the reference only to the environment variable example: password: 'appname_password'
