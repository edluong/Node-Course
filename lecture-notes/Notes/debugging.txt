--Debugging--
-log messages to debug our app
-should use the node debugger because we do not need to write code to inject into our code
-use the built in debug package
-npm i debug (to install)

-export the environment variable DEBUG to toggle which types of messages we want to see
-export DEBUG=app:startup //we will see all message regarding the app startup
-export DEBUG=app:* //we will see all message
-export DEBUG= //toggle to no namespace

-PROs of using debug:
*it will change the message to different colors than using console.log

-faster way of setting the environment variable
-example express-demo$ DEBUG=app:db nodemon index.js //this is a shortcut

-in reality we will not need to have multiple functions for debugging; can condense the code
